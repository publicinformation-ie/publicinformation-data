# Changelog

All notable changes to the Public Bodies dataset will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Public Bodies dataset (Slice 1) with all 883 known public sector organizations
- JSON-LD (single `@context` + `@graph`) and CSV formats for Public Bodies
- CSVW metadata for the Public Bodies CSV
- JSON Schema with `enum` constraints tied to the `body-type` and `foi-scope` vocabularies
- Controlled vocabularies: `body-type` (3 terms), `foi-scope` (2 terms) — trimmed to terms actually backed by pipeline data
